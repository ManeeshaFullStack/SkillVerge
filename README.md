# SkillVerge – Online E-Learning Platform 🚀

**SkillVerge** is an interactive e-learning platform offering structured course content, seminar videos, and quizzes. This project is built as part of my full-stack developer journey to apply and strengthen my frontend skills using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery** — with future expansion planned into full-stack with backend technologies.

## 🌟 Project Overview

## 🧠 Learning Focus

SkillVerge is designed to demonstrate my ability to plan, design, and build a professional web application from scratch. While currently focused on the frontend, it lays the foundation for future backend integration with technologies like Java Spring Boot and MySQL.

This project was built during my Bootstrap and frontend learning phase. I aimed to test my understanding of:
- Grid layouts and responsive design using Bootstrap
- DOM manipulation and events with JavaScript/jQuery
- UI/UX structure suitable for an LMS-type platform
